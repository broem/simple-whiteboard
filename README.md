# simple-whiteboard

A simple interactive whiteboard designed for quick collaborative whiteboarding sessions. 
 
``` npm i ```

``` npm run start ``` -- webpack

``` npm run server ``` -- express

The project uses websockets (socket.io) to communicate drawing between separate clients. This is very much a work in progress.
